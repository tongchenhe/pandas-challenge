From the two provided csv files of schools and students' data in a certain district, we made a jupyter notebook that contains tables of:
* A district summary that shows the general information of the schools and students
* A school summary that shows the school's name, size, budget, students' average math and reading scores, and passing rate of each school
* Highest and lowest performing schools sorted by overall passing rate
* Average math and reading scores of every grade in each school
* Average scores and passing rates categorized by school's spending range (per student)
* Average scores and passing rates by school size
* Average scores and passing rates by school type (Charter or District)

A written analysis of two conclusions drawn from the data is also included at the end of the notebook.
